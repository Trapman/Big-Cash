#basic structure for making a TCP socket connection:

import socket 

mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80))    #just enter a website, followed by a port (usually 80)

'''different ports:
email = 25
login = 23
web server = 80
web server (secured) = 443
personal email = 109 or 110'''


#writing an HTTP request in Python:

import socket 

mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80))    #just enter a website, followed by a port (usually 80)

cmd = 'GET http://data.pr4e.org/romeo.txt HTTP:/1.0\n\n'.encode()
mysock.send(cmd)

while True:
    data = mysock.recv(512)
    if(len(data)<1):
        break
    print(data.decode())
mysock.close()

#another ex:

import socket

mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80))
cmd = 'GET http://data.pr4e.org/intro-short.txt HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n'.encode()
mysock.send(cmd)

while True:
    data = mysock.recv(512)
    if (len(data) < 1):
        break
    print(data.decode(), end='')
mysock.close()


#BeautifulSoup Parsing Webpages:
import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = input('Enter -  ')
html = urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

tags = soup('a')
for tag in tags:
    print(tag.get('href', None))
    
#note that url must be entered in the format of https://www.binance.com

Scraping Numbers from HTML using BeautifulSoup In this assignment you will write a Python program similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllink2.py. The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, and parse the data, extracting numbers and compute the sum of the numbers in the file.

We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.html (Sum=2553)
Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_78969.html (Sum ends with 2)
You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL. Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.
Data Format
The file is a table of names and comment counts. You can ignore most of the data in the file except for lines like the following:

<tr><td>Modu</td><td><span class="comments">90</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Kenzie</td><td><span class="comments">88</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Hubert</td><td><span class="comments">87</span></td></tr>
You are to find all the <span> tags in the file and pull out the numbers from the tag and sum the numbers.
Look at the sample code provided. It shows how to find all of a certain kind of tag, loop through the tags and extract the various aspects of the tags.

...
# Retrieve all of the anchor tags
tags = soup('a')
for tag in tags:
   # Look at the parts of a tag
   print 'TAG:',tag
   print 'URL:',tag.get('href', None)
   print 'Contents:',tag.contents[0]
   print 'Attrs:',tag.attrs
You need to adjust this code to look for span tags and pull out the text content of the span tag, convert them to integers and add them up to complete the assignment.
Sample Execution

$ python3 solution.py
Enter - http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.html
Count 50
Sum 2...

Following Links in Python

In this assignment you will write a Python program that expands on http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllinks.py. The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, extract the href= vaues from the anchor tags, scan for a tag that is in a particular position relative to the first name in the list, follow that link and repeat the process a number of times and report the last name you find.

We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the name for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment

Sample problem: Start at http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Fikret.html 
Find the link at position 3 (the first name is 1). Follow that link. Repeat this process 4 times. The answer is the last name that you retrieve.
Sequence of names: Fikret Montgomery Mhairade Butchi Anayah 
Last name in sequence: Anayah
Actual problem: Start at: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Aarez.html 
Find the link at position 18 (the first name is 1). Follow that link. Repeat this process 7 times. The answer is the last name that you retrieve.
Hint: The first character of the name of the last page that you will load is: C
Strategy
The web pages tweak the height between the links and hide the page after a few seconds to make it difficult for you to do the assignment without writing a Python program. But frankly with a little effort and patience you can overcome these attempts to make it a little harder to complete the assignment without writing a Python program. But that is not the point. The point is to write a clever Python program to solve the program.

import urllib
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = input('Enter URL:')
counter = input('Enter count:')
position = input('Enter position:')

for i in range(int(counter)):
	html = urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()
	soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
	tags = soup('a')
	number = 0
	for tag in tags:
		number += 1
		if number == int(position):
			url = tag.get('href')
			if i == int(counter)-1:
				print(tag.contents[0])
			break
